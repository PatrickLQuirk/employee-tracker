## Installation
You will first need to clone the repository onto your local machine. Then you will need to open the repo folder in your terminal, and run the command 'npm install'. Then you will need to open the connection.js file in the db folder and change the username and password to match your MySQL credentials. The final bit of setup will involve opening the mysql shell and running 'source ./db/db.sql' and 'source ./db/schema.sql'. See the following video for a demonstration of this process: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KBt93pRHJL3KMb3yjlE3Ow9ZAvUyieik/view?usp=sharing

## Usage
To use the application, open the repo folder in your terminal and run the command 'node index.js'. The application will start, and you will be placed in a main menu. Answer the questions as you please to view and add items to the database, or update and employee's role.
